Handling CSV to SQLite: 
- I've got all of the information for each column 
- Now what does one do with the entries themselves, going down through the rows?
	- They ought to be divided into Preconditions, Postconditions Accept, and Postconditions Reject
	- It can be as simple as ripping the columns out
		- Rip out the columns for the various virtues and precons etc, store these in separate datastructures with pre and 2 post dataframes, and append the IDs too
		- Set each of these to have a column which is true for the specific pre post value, and then the other two as false 
		
This needs a far more sophisticated program than I anticipated:
	- 7 virtues + 5 passions + 1 basic 
	- Virtues and Passions should be split into 3 categories of precons etc, then 3 by person, then under precons 2 as above or below 
	- Each of these will have the story action column just ripped across
	- Then, they will be committed to their respective tables
