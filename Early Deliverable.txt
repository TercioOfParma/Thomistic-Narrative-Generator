Early Deliverable:

- Structure it in terms of how can you get more human interactions in stories 
- Explain how that works
- Then go into active grace theory 
- Translate Theological Theory of Grace into a Computational Deliverable 

- The key bit is the text 


that there are 4 tests God is going to give when you ask something from Him
1. As if God said no, would you still ask for it?
2. When you see the brokenness of the world, would you still ask for it? or would you despair?
3. When you see how rotten the Church is, are you going to lose hope? or are you going to still keep going?
4. You will go into a trial where you're going to think to yourself. Does God even care about this issue?
