Scope for Narrative Generation:
Will is impacted by the following:
	- All of the Sub virtues and virtues covered inherently (I.E without other factors)
	- Dispositions from the Holy Spirit
	- Emotional Relationships between each character in relationships 
Characters can impact each other:
	- Killing
	- Producing Children
	- Emotional Relationships 
	- Basically, MEXICA but with more passions 
- Structures of life are entirely random, and then scored by the particular virtue selected (NOT subvirtue) 
- Arbitrary distinctions between the Three Ages of the Interior Life, which are triggered by charity specifically
- All virtues and subvirtues are hardcoded 

Structure: 
	Relationship:
		- Passions to person 
	Subvirtue:
		- Overarching Virtue
		- Particular Story Events Triggered by it
