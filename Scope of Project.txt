Scope for Narrative Generation:
Will is impacted by the following:
	- All of the Sub virtues and virtues covered inherently (I.E without other factors)
	- Dispositions from the Holy Spirit
	- Emotional Relationships between each character in relationships 
Characters can impact each other:
	- Killing
	- Producing Children
	- Emotional Relationships 
	- Basically, MEXICA but with more passions 
- Structures of life are entirely random, and then scored by the particular virtue selected (NOT subvirtue) 
- Arbitrary distinctions between the Three Ages of the Interior Life, which are triggered by charity specifically
- All virtues and subvirtues are hardcoded 
- Lives are generated concurrently, and actions applied in "real time" to the lives
- Mutations will be the primary means of evolving, and this'll be the changing of a decision and regenerating the tree after that point 
- Chaining events together in the JSON



Structure: 
	Relationship:
		- Passions to person 
	Subvirtue:
		- Overarching Virtue
		- Particular Story Events Triggered by it 
- Take Suarez's view of growth in charity as it's easier to implement in the given time 

PROBLEMS:
- Strange problems with there being an infinite loop on self implemented Linked Lists 
- Problems with JSON made it necessary to convert to CSV and then to SQLite 
- Problems with this format has made it necessary to use Python 3 with Pandas to split into separate tables 
- The way this python worked meant that names with spaces needed to have the _ removed to represent them 



- MAKE CLEAR THE DIFFICULTIES IN THE PAPER EXPLICITLY
	- JSON VS SQLite 
	- SHOW how you can solve problems 
	- Problem of emotional variations to abstract away 

8th-15th July:
	- Draft a document containing all of the different classes, variables and such in LaTeX, how they are implemented X
	- Design the algorithm that governs what the will does X
	- Add more story_actions from the Secunda Secundae Partis 
	- Read and analyse that study that's 38 pages X
	- Finish off thinking about current story_actions 
	- Port the AWK program for Bible Verses to Java X
15th-22nd July:
	- Look at the Contemporary Narrative Gen Literature X
	- Redact down the variables from what they currently are X
	- Implement the JSON loading classes for the classes <-- Began, converted over to SQLite X
	- Integrate Scripture loading into the project X <-- To the extent it even loads the scripture bank 
	- Basic action list generation X
22nd July- 29th July: 
	- Markov Chain Name Generator X 
	- Read plot evaluation literature 
	- Look at Contemporary MOEA literature 
	- Implement random emotion variation algorithm X
	- Implement will mechanic on the action list (Sorta) 
29th July-5th August:
	- Adding additional actions 
	- Multi Objective Algorithm Implementation
5th August-12th August:
	- Finish MOEA 

12th August-19th August:
	- Draft questions for the study 
19th August-26th August: 
	- Begin to gather people to read the stories and get information out of them
