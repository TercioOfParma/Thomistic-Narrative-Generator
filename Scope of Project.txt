Scope for Narrative Generation:
Will is impacted by the following:
	- All of the Sub virtues and virtues covered inherently (I.E without other factors)
	- Dispositions from the Holy Spirit
	- Emotional Relationships between each character in relationships 
Characters can impact each other:
	- Killing
	- Producing Children
	- Emotional Relationships 
	- Basically, MEXICA but with more passions 
- Structures of life are entirely random, and then scored by the particular virtue selected (NOT subvirtue) 
- Arbitrary distinctions between the Three Ages of the Interior Life, which are triggered by charity specifically
- All virtues and subvirtues are hardcoded 
- Lives are generated concurrently, and actions applied in "real time" to the lives
- Mutations will be the primary means of evolving, and this'll be the changing of a decision and regenerating the tree after that point 
- Chaining events together in the JSON



Structure: 
	Relationship:
		- Passions to person 
	Subvirtue:
		- Overarching Virtue
		- Particular Story Events Triggered by it 
- Take Suarez's view of growth in charity as it's easier to implement in the given time 

EXCEEDING EXPECTATIONS:
	- Was able to add Second person and third person postconditions despite thinking it was too complicated 
	- Added a calm down function and an emotional drift function 
	- Added 900 emotional, relational and virtuous state indicators via a script 

PROBLEMS:
- Strange problems with there being an infinite loop on self implemented Linked Lists 
- Problems with JSON made it necessary to convert to CSV and then to SQLite 
- Problems with this format has made it necessary to use Python 3 with Pandas to split into separate tables 
- The way this python worked meant that names with spaces needed to have the _ removed to represent them 
- Lots of hassle with Pandas and figuring out that I needed to approach with categorical differentiation on Postcons and Precons etc.
- Does the end or the plot define where the MOEA should be used, or some sort of layered approach with weights on a specific pattern (Poetics?)
- Decided to write my own LinkedLists, big mistake, wasted a couple of days 
- Characters are Sociopaths 


- Make mention of Normal Forms in report 
- Take note of controversy and of how uncommon the Thomistic view of virtues and passions actually are (definitely limit words) 
- Critical analysis of the model in comparison to other psychological models 
- Make more computing references (Ought to be a majority) 
- COMPUTING IS EXTREMELY IMPORTANT, REMEMBER THAT 


- MAKE CLEAR THE DIFFICULTIES IN THE PAPER EXPLICITLY
	- JSON VS SQLite 
	- SHOW how you can solve problems 
	- Problem of emotional variations to abstract away 

8th-15th July:
	- Draft a document containing all of the different classes, variables and such in LaTeX, how they are implemented X
